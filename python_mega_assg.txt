
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
--> python is called general purpose language because it can be used in many domains and have good in-built libraries. Python is called high-level programming language because it is easy for non-technical/begineers to understand and grasp programming easily due to easy syntax.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
--> Python syntax are designed in such a manner that we doesn't require to declare the type of data/variable. Python has in-built garbage collector and hence python is called dynamically typed language. 

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
--> Pros : 1] It's begineer friendly, 2] It has simple and easy syntax, 3] It has lots of libraries for Digital domain work, 4] It has Good coder's community, 5] It is object oriented.
Cons :  1] It's High Level Language and working efficiency may be slow sometimes, 2] python cant be used for less time complexity work, 3] Python is week in Browser and Mobile Computing.   

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
--> Python can be mostly used in every domain such as Data Science, Artifical Intelligence, Web Development, App Development, Programming etc.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
--> Variable are the name given to the memory location of data values stored and are used to access the location.
Integer variable declaration :  a = 10   # 'a' is the name of memory location which has stored data as 10.
String  variable declaration :  b = "String type".

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
--> There is Inbuilt function named "input" which can be used to take user input in console. 
Example :   1]      user_input = input("Enter your name : ")       # for string  data type 
            2]   numeric_value = int(input("Enter your Age : "))   # for integer data type.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
--> Default datatype of input() function is String.

Q8. What is type casting?
--> Type casting is used to convert one form of data type into another form of data type. We can convert integer data type into string or vice-versa.
Example : consider,  
	   a = "10" 
	   print(type(a))  --> string
	   b = int(a)   # here we converted string data type into integer using int() function.
	   print(type(b))  --> integer    

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
--> Yes, We can take more than one input from user using split() function. Split() function splits the given input into different parts with separtor provided.
Example : Taking two input values  
a,b = input().split()

Q10. What are keywords?
--> Keywords are pre-defined words in python which has its meaning which is pre-defined and we cannot change the meaning.
example : auto, if...else, def, 

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
--> No, we cannot use keywords as a variable. Keywords have pre-defined meaning and we cannot change its pre-defined meaning.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
--> Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Indentation in python are important and it indicates a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
--> Yes we can throw output using in-built print() function
Example : a = 10

	  print(a)  --> 10

--------------------------------------------------------------------	 

Q14. What are operators in Python?
--> Operators are used to perform the operations on variables and values. Operators can be defined as symbol's which are responsible for a particular operation between two operands. Eg: Arithmetic,Bitwise,Assignment,Comparison,Logical operators.

--------------------------------------------------------------------	 

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
--> / is Float division operator
consider, a = 3, b = 5  
	print(b/a) --> 1.666667
         
// is Integer division operator
consider, a = 3, b = 5  
	print(b/a) --> 1

--------------------------------------------------------------------

if(num % 2 == 0) :
    print("Given Number is Even.")
else :
    print("Given Number is Odd.")
--------------------------------------------------------------------	
Q18. What are boolean operator?
--> Boolean operator are used to return either 'True' or 'False' value based on given conditions. True or False are commonly known as boolean values. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------	
Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0                       -->  0

True and False and True      -->  False

1 or 0 or 0		     -->  1
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------	 

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
--> Conditionls statement are used to verify/check the given conditions and perform different computations or actions. The three different conditional statements in python are 'if', 'elif' and 'else'.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
--> 1] 'If' :- It first checks given condition and if it is True then 'if' block get executed. If it is false then loop further moves in 'elif' or 'else' block as per given condition.
    2] 'elif' :- It checks condition and if condition is true then 'elif' block get executed. If condition is false then loop further moves in next 'elif' or 'else' block as per given condition. 
    3] 'else' :- it gets executed if 'if' block is false. it is optionl and can be written without 'if' block.
--------------------------------------------------------------------	
 
Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
